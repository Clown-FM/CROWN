To replay a target program using the testcase files generated by CROWN-FP,
you have to define CROWN_DIR in Makefile which represents a relative path 
to CROWN-FP. For example
$ CROWN_DIR=path/to/CROWN-FP

Also, you have to add the following options to gcc command:
 -I${CROWN_DIR}/include -L${CROWN_DIR}/lib -lcrown-replay -m32

You can measure the branch coverage of a target program using gcov based on
the testcase files generated by CROWN-FP as follows:
 
$ CROWN_DIR=path/to/CROWN-FP
$ ...
$ gcc -o target_replay target.c -I${CROWN_DIR}/include -L${CROWN_DIR}/lib -lcrown-replay -m32 --coverage
